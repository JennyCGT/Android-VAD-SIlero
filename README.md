Create an app with Voice Activity Detection using Silero model

This code takes as a base of this repository that offers distinct models https://github.com/gkonovalov/android-vad. I have made some tests and chose Silero, on my case was the model with better functionality.

The first button record and use VAD at the same time, also this functionality have a timeout if the VAD does not detect a human voice in 3 seconds the system stops the record.
